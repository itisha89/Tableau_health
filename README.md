**Problem Statement:**

In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified obesity, diabetes, and blood pressure as the primary global health concerns. In response, the UK's National Health Service (NHS) initiated an analysis to understand the prevalence of these conditions in the country and across the globe. The aim is to explore patterns and correlations in the prevalence of obesity, raised blood pressure, and diabetes over time and across various countries and continents. This analysis will help the NHS to identify at-risk populations and take proactive steps toward addressing these health challenges.

The problem involves visualizing complex health data, including the prevalence of BMI>=30 (obesity), raised blood pressure, and age-standardized diabetes prevalence, in a manner that allows for easy comparison across countries, regions, and over time. Insights drawn from these visualizations will inform public health strategies.

**Technology Used:**

Tableau Desktop 2023.2.0: Used for data analysis and visualization. Tableau was selected due to its robust features for handling complex datasets, creating interactive dashboards, and generating meaningful visualizations.

**Finding 1:**

A total of 6 countries falls under red zone.

Majority of the countries fall under green zone and hence have least prevalence of obesity.

UK falls under green zone. Hence, we can conclude that UK is safer, and the prevalence of Obesity is much lower in the UK when compared to other countries. 


**Finding 2:**

Since 1975, women have shown higher obesity rates than men.

The prevalence of obesity in both the genders have risen constantly over the years.

The obesity rate in women went above the average from 1994 and that in men from 2000.

**Finding 3:**

It is estimated that the prevalence of obesity in the UK across sexes would increase to 33.72 % in the year 2023.

It is estimated that the prevalence of obesity in the UK for women would increase to 34.10% in the year 2023.

It is estimated that the prevalence of obesity in the UK for men would increase to 33.72 % in the year 2023.

**Finding 4:**

Countries like South Africa, Syrian Arab Republic, Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Greece, Ukraine, Suriname, and Venezuela have the approximately 18% (rounded-off) of prevalence of obesity which is same as the UK.

**Finding 5:**

Oceania shows an opposite behavior as compared to the other continents in the spread of BMI, BP and diabetes.

In Oceania, the BMI and diabetes are above the average level but the BP is below average level. 

**Finding 6:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6238b30-a222-491e-8087-0e6555195129)

There is a positive correlation in prevalence of obesity (BMI) and Diabetes across the world.

The countries were divided into 3 (using elbow method) clusters (as shown through different colors) and it was observed that distinct clusters were formed. This means that countries in each cluster behave similar.

**Finding 7:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39b2b4f8-e0ea-4f43-91f9-3f7dcdf54d0d)

There is little to no correlation between BMI and diabetes for the countries having similar prevalence of obesity (Finding 4) as that of the UK.

**Finding 8:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc8ebd89-a2cc-4685-beea-4cdfb8c0d181)

For the countries sharing the similar obesity rates as that of the UK, the obesity rates have gone beyond the average values but the diabetes rates have always been below the average values.
